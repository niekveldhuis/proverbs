This project reduces all Sumerian proverbs (and all Sumerian literature currently in [ORACC](http://oracc.org)) to a sequence of sign values and sign names. Goal is to see whether proverbs use, on average, more distinct signs and more distinct sign values than other literary texts.
Some of the code is imported from niekveldhuis/compass/utils and may not work unless you have that cloned.
